/**
 * A automobile has a fuel level and an efficiency
 *
 * P3.7. * Modify the given class Automobile so that it has the following
 * properties. An automobile has a certain fuel efficiency (measured in
 * km/liters) and a certain amount of fuel in the gas tank. The efficiency is
 * initialized in the constructor method via the parameter, and the initial fuel
 * level is 0. Supply a method called drive that simulates driving the
 * automobile for a certain distance, reducing the amount of gasoline in the
 * fuel tank. Also supply methods getGasInTank, returning the current amount of
 * gasoline in the fuel tank, and addGas, to add gasoline to the fuel tank. Look
 * at the tester code (AutomobileTester.java) for help in understanding these
 * methods

 * Difficulty: Easy
